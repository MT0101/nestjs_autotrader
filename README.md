## Details

A project in a very early version. It is the groundwork for a future used car trading platform. It was built in the NestJS framework, which I will definitely be tying my future to. Unfortunately, due to a small supply of time, the project is in a heavily demo version.

## Planned improvements

💪 bugs fixing <br>
💪 building a frontend in React.js + Redux Toolkit (Sass, Atomic Design) <br>
💪 addition of the possibility of generating a price report on the ad indicated <br>
💪 more comprehensive caching on Redis <br>
💪 adding more security features <br>
💪 addition of the possibility of sending confirmation e-mails for adding an ad <br>
💪 addition of unit, integration and E2E tests <br>
💪 code refactoring to achieve a clean state <br>
